title: Normalization (WIP)
---

In databases, normalization is the process by which a DB designer structures the DB in accordance to best practices, or what are known as 'normal forms.' Normal forms aid in reducing complexity, redundancy, and improving performance.

It takes a lot of forethought and comprehensive understanding of not just the data, but also in how that data is to be used in order to achieve normal forms.

In information architecture, similar rules apply.
