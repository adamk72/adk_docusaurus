## How I got here
I'm relatively new to Vue. I've been programming for years with C/C++/Objective-C and a host of other languages.

Then I took a break from coding, doing a lot of non-tech stuff along with some technical project management.

Come the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to get back into the programming game, and I started easy, with Javascript, a language I was familiar with from the old days, but had changed significantly over years.

I also discovered React, Vue, and Angular. A friend got me into React, which I love and I got quickly acquainted and up to speed on that participating in startup that used a React frontend and a Django backend.

Then another friend got me onto Vue, and I like as much as I like React (though I really love React's hooks). I've decided that this time around, I'm going to put my education to paper (as it were) so that other people can benefit from what I've learned on this journey

## Assumptions

This won't be beginner friendly, per se. I'm creating this site mostly as reference that I'm familiar with and can easily get to where I need to be.

As such, I'll be skipping the basics, like how for loops and other control features work, for instance. I'll also skip the basics of installation, since you can locate that at [Vue's website (v2)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

Also, I'm going to skip over Vue that is instantiated as an object, like this:
```javascript
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello Vue!'
  }
})
```
:::tip

Creating an app this way and mounting to the DOM is one way to apply Vue directly to a high-level .html file (or any .html file, really).

## Structure

The sidebar will contain broad topics. My goal is to create incremental steps, so that as you go through, each section builds simply on the previous. I realize I'm going to have to make some jumps back and forth between topics, and I'll try to do that with links rather than repeating myself.

I hope I learn a lot and I hope you enjoy and learn a lot as well.


## Debugging Issues
I'll put major Vue-specific issues I encounter here. You can find more on Javascript in general at [Debugging Tips](js/debugging-tips.md).
