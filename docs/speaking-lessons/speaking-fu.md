So you wanna learn how to be a grand speaker on stage in and in life, huh?

Well, friend, it takes a bit of work and a lot of practice to get you speaking-fu up to snuff where you can speak at the adult table.

Funnily enough... it all starts with idle conversation first.

## Let's learn how to chit-chat first.
There's a big lesson to take away from small talk.

## Kicking the "Um" Habit

Theses are arguably the most common disfluencies in the English language (in the order you should work on fixing them):

- You know
- So
- Um
- The Long And &mdash; "And um"
- Really really & very very

_So_ fix these and you'll, _you know_, have made, _um_, some _really really_ big strides in improving your speaking skills, _and um_, that's _very, very_ cool.

Why this particular order for working on eliminating them? As pervasive as 'ums' and 'ahs' and other minor speaking tics are, they're easy(-ish) to fix once you notice them.

### No, I don't know
'You know' is almost a plague, that know one seems to even notice, you know? It's a colloquialism that isn't that bad on occasion, however, it tends to be used way out to context and is more often a filler word along the lines of, you know, "um."

(link to more on "You Know" theory)

### So
I'll admit, I put 'so' near the top because I personally overuse this word, but I hear it a lot in conversations an in interviews. It most often has two roles as a disfluency: a starter or an ender.

At the start of the sentence, you may find yourself using 'so' becaus you don't want to simply start saying something "out of the blue." It's totally okay to just start the next sentence!

At the end of the sentence, it's a residual thought, a linger hope that the other person will take over the next part of the conversation. I don't hear this quite as a often as 'so as starter' but it's worth noting.
