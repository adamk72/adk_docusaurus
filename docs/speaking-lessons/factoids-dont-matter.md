American poet Emily Dickinson famously said, “If you take care of the small things, the big things take care of themselves.”

In speechmaking, interviews, meetings, video conferences, and even in daily conversation, however, there are plenty of small things you should completely let go of, even if they are, in technical terms, factually incorrect or imprecise.

What do I mean?

If, in a conversation , you’re recounting to your friends that, “Two days ago I went on a fishing trip,” but the reality of the situation was that it happened <em>three</em> days ago, you don’t need to take a moment to correct yourself by retracing with something like, “Uh, actually, three days ago, anyway…”

Your friends likely won’t notice or even care that you made the hiccup (with the expectation of your most pedantic friends who happened to be paying attention to your calendar of events). The timing of your event is more factoid than it is fact; it has little to no bearing on the validity of the story.

This is doubly true in situations where the people you’re speaking with are at best recent acquaintances, like at a party, or they don’t know you at all, such as when you’re doing an interview on the radio or a podcast. Even if you’re a semi-public figure, your audience doesn’t know about the tiny details, the factoids, of your life. They only know you from within the context of the event or broadcast they’re listening to you from or your overall public persona.

What makes a tiny detail tiny, then? Well, it’s any particular statement or bit of information that is trivial in nature -- which is exactly the definition of a factoid. If you were to take the comment out of the sentence or train of thought, it would make essentially zero difference to the telling of the overall story. It might help to keep in mind the Peak-End Rule: Intense moments and the final moment of an experience is what people remember (and/or care about) the most. Factoids are hardly intense moments in a conversation or speech.

In the fishing example, you could have said, “I went on a fishing trip!” and that would have sufficed -- the actual timing of it is far overshadowed by the interest garnered by the fishing trip itself. The boldness of the statement adds an intensity to the environment that makes for better overall engagement; something that shouldn't be ruined by trivial additions.

In this example, since human beings are so temporally oriented, someone is bound to ask, “when?” and the answer to that doesn’t have to be a specific day. “Recently” would work just as well as “three days ago.” While context should help guide you on how to respond, the specificity and accuracy of that response rarely matters. The important point is that you created a sense of engagement, rather than distraction.

[Side note: Mind the fact that if you’re being asked questions by a police officer about a crime committed near the very lake you went fishing at, then yes, it helps to correct yourself and provide information as accurately as possible. In such a case, ‘when’ goes from being a factoid to a fact.]

Other types of details can be ignored or passed by if misspoken as well. The precise number of shoes you have in your closet, the actual color of her hair or his shirt, the position of the chair in the room, or the exact temperature on a given day will hardly change the conversation. Often, it’s numbers and time increments that throw us off our speaking game, but sometimes “reasons” and “whys” will be a distraction too. Basically anytime you feel the need to backup and rephrase something that is ultimately inconsequential or you add as simple flavor text unrelated to or unnecessary for the topic, you’re at risk of losing your audience.

If you’re looking to be a charismatic, engaging, or just outright fun speaker, then let the little things go. As always, it take practice to understand what the truly tiny details are, so here are my suggestions for what to pay attention to:
s

1. As I’ve already said, if you find yourself backtracking in the conversation in order to offer a clarification from something you recently said, ask yourself, “Why does it matter that I go over this again?” You’ll start to find that the answer to that question is often along the lines of , “Because I messed up and need to get my factoids straight.” No, you don’t. You need to keep your audience engaged. Facts relevant to the story, not factoids, should be correct. Know the difference.

2. Retracing your steps to correct tiny details can actually cause distress in your audience because they need to use extra cognitive effort to realign with what you’re saying. Keep an eye and ears on your audience (or your host in the case of a broadcast interview or podcast). Are their eyes glazing over? Do they look/sound like they might want to ask a question? Is there anything uncomfortable in their visage? Chances are you took a u-turn they couldn’t follow or really didn’t care about. Reroute and get back on track quickly.

3. If you retrace part of your speech and realize you lost track of the point you were trying to make, the questions you were trying to answer, or the train of thought you were on, then chances are you’ve over-corrected. It’s fine to let the tangent go and hand the conversation over to someone else or pause to remember or ask for assistance in recalling. Do it with humility and as importantly, ask yourself what was so important that you took off on a side track to begin with? As with suggestion #1, likely it wasn’t really that important.

4. If you find yourself saying things like, “I think it was…,” or “... and I guess it doesn’t really matter…,” or “well, maybe it was actually…,” or the classic, “I digress,” then you’re probably delving into the realm of too tiny details and factoids. Learn to see where these phrases crop up and allow yourself to let the last clause you wanted to correct stand rather than trying to retract it.

Good speaking habits come from paying attention to the small details -- and then knowing which ones to let pass by and which ones to focus on. Factoids aren’t small things, they’re inconsequential and distracting things. In that regard, Emily Dickinson’s aphorism still holds true.
