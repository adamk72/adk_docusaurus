It's a conversation -- but not.
Are you Pitching, Proposing, or Persuading?

Pitching - describe the uniqueness of the product, the situation, or what you have to offer. Go into some details, but not too much (depending on time; highlights only to start). Intrigue your audience. What's being solved?

PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.
Listen to the other podcasts that have played and see how you'd answer those same questions.


Be specific -- avoid, "whatevers" "stuffs" and "things"
Don't sweat the small details.
Know when to hold the space, know when to fold the space, know when to surrender the space.

Don't sound bored with yourself. Don't exhale like you're in an exacerbated state or exhausted.
Watch for unnecessary apologies, like "I don't want to sound like I don't know what I'm doing" Own the situation. better to say, "This is place I could have done better, but here's what happened." It's a learning experience for us all. Teach us.

On the flip side, don't overdo it. Keep your humility in check. (Same goes for interviewers)

It's okay to "start over" with your train of thought (on edited podcasts). Take a breath and start from the beginning (don't try to continue a clause, phrase or word; it won't match up well in post)

Don't linger on words and draw them out.

Remember, people can't see you (usually, unless your being videotaped), so doing the "thinking" thing doesn't work well.

Addressing the Imposter Syndrome. I honestly think most people have this bouncing around their heads. The key is not to let it get to you by remembering you're offering a gift of your experience and knowledge. You have something to share. 

Make it a game!
