The 45/45 Rule

My goal is two fold
1) To improve the system so that the leadership can focus on leading and growing the company rather than dealing with the vagaries of day-to-day fires.
2) With the improved system, allow companies to be able to flex-hire -- that is, have the band-width to bring on highly skilled workers for short term projects as well as take the time to find and hire the best workers on your own schedule.

Here's the deal with a well architected system and accompanying cultural shift -- it is more attractive to work for a company that that has its shit together than it is to not.

It's more attractive to fund or buy into a company that is running smoothly.

At least on your side, it's easier to merge.

Etc.

The 45 Rules says this:

Given a role that divides itself between two different domains of knowledge or expertise, the results of the combined efforts is less than if the person in that role concentrated on single domain.

That is, if you split your time 50/50 between two work activities, say customer acquisition and operations, your results will only be 45/45 of the total output. 10 of your time and effort, probably more, is wasted in the cognitive and physical transitions that you need to make in code shifting like that.

Essentially, multi-tasking is a myth.
