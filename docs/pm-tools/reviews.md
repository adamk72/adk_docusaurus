This is a work in progress as far as details go, but safe to say that these particular software platforms will all get better than decent reviews from me. Each has its quirks, advantages, and limitations and how useful they are to you will depend on you and your company's situation.

Full reviews are at the top of the list; otherwise the content is just historical information.

## ClickUp

### History

Founded in 2017, ClickUp is the new kid on the block, promoting itself heavily on social media. It recently raised an additional round of funding the pushed its market cap up to $1B.

### Quick Review

On general principle, I like ClickUp. It's got a nice UI and the price is right too for most small teams.

If you're a small internal team, I would say ClickUp is ideal for you. It has some pretty nifty features for displaying tables and boards in various ways that suit the individual user and in particular, I like that it natively supports documentation that can be shared within a "Space" (which is what the general project container is called).

If your team has a need for guests to occasionally interact, ClickUp goes from being ideal to just okay. While you can have a ton of guests, it gets messy fairly quickly when attempting to create Folders (another part of ClickUp's hierarchy just below Space) that only certain people can see.

And for software development teams, it's _almost_ okay. When you look through the marketing, it appears as if ClickUp really took into account a lot of what software developers needs, especially if your team uses Scrum or Kanban approaches. However, after an initial trial run, I found that the services were simply not adequate to support an major endeavor. If you're considering this for small internal team, it's not bad; but it's horrible if you have to bring in contractors.

And with all that, despite being almost 4 years old, ClickUp is still somewhat buggy. Random screen updates and incomplete renderings can make for a lot of distractions and worry. I wouldn't run a mission critical project on it.

As I said, on general principle, I like ClickUp. I think it'll work well for a small to medium sized marketing team, for example. But it simply is no good for a team that is working on a multitude of complex projects and/or is seeking to grow to enterprise level.

## Jira

### History

Aside from Bugzilla, Jira might be considered the granddad of software project management software. Created by the dual-CEO company Atlassian (TEAM) in 2002, it is pervasive across all size of tech companies.

### Quick Review

As a software developer and program/project manager, Jira is by far my favorite project management software. It is highly customizable (almost to a fault), relatively easy to use, and importantly, it's focused on facilitating Scrum and Kanban style development.

Once you get familiar with Jira's issue types, workflows, and the ever important concept of schemes and permissions and _then_ you start to browse the myriad of add-ons, you'll find there's very little you can't do with Jira.

But should you?

That's the rub with Jira. You can do a lot with it, but you also have to put a lot of work into making your more specific ideas come to light. The benefit is that if you do it right, Jira is very scalable and adaptable for even full enterprise endeavors. And this can be costly, depending on your company's size and which add-ons you're considering.

Atlassian is trying to make things easier by moving Jira fully into the cloud, deprecating their server version of the software, but that is currently in transition and is somewhat nerfed from my most recent experiences with it.

If you're looking to support a software team, then Jira is the way to go (there are some best practices I can recommend in setting up and running a Jira instance). If you're part of a marketing team or other non-technical company, Jira can be adapted to your needs. If you already have a license for it, then maybe it'd be worth your trouble. But if you're starting from scratch, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.

## Notion

Not really touted as PM software, Notion has proven to be very flexible and is used by project managers as such. It is relatively new to the scene of management software.

## Asana

Founded in 2008, Asana (ASAN) is probably the most well-known PM software among non-technical people, yet it was founded by an ex-Facebook founder and an ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineer.

## Monday.com

Competing with ClickUp for the most advertised application, this company was founded in 2012 as a spin-off from Wix.com. They've raised significant amounts of funding over the past several years.

## Trello

Trello has a long history -- created in 2011 by FogCreek Software, spun off in 2014, and then sold to Atlassian in 2017. Easy to use, Trello is a very lightweight Kanban style task manager, it is also fairly well known among non-techies and techies alike.

## Teamwork

Founded in 2007, this Ireland based company is used by some high-profile companies, such as Disney and HP.
