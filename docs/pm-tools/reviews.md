This is a work in progress as far as details go, but safe to say that these particular software platforms will all get better than decent reviews from me. Each has its quirks, advantages, and limitations and how useful they are to you will depend on you and your company's situation.

In the meantime, here's a little history snippet for most of them.

## Asana
Founded in 2008, Asana (ASAN) is probably the most well-known PM software among non-technical people, yet it was founded by an ex-Facebook founder and an ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineer.

## ClickUp
Founded in 2017, ClickUp is the new kid on the block, promoting itself heavily on social media. It recently raised an additional round of funding the pushed its market cap up to $1B.

## FogBugz
-- TBD --

## Jira
Aside from Bugzilla, Jira might be considered the granddad of software project management software. Created by the dual-CEO company Atlassian (TEAM) in 2002, it is pervasive across all size of tech companies.

## Monday.com
Competing with ClickUp for the most advertised application, this company was founded in 2012 as a spin-off from Wix.com. They've raised significant amounts of funding over the past several years.

## Notion
Not really touted as PM software, Notion has proven to be very flexible and is used by project managers as such.

## PivotalTracker
-- TBD --

## Trello
Trello has a long history -- created in 2011 by FogCreek Software, spun off in 2014, and then sold to Atlassian in 2017. Easy to use, Trello is a very lightweight Kanban style task manager, it is also fairly well known among non-techies and techies alike. 

## Teamwork
Founded in 2007, this Ireland based company is used by some high-profile companies, such as Disney and HP.
