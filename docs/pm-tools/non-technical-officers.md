title: Founders, Officers, and Hiring Managers

There’s a rumor goin’ round that all one has to do is hire a couple of software developers, a.k.a “coders” and presto, the dreams of garage to penthouse is suddenly fulfilled.

Too bad it isn’t true. Programming has a mythology around that colors the expectations of both non-technical folks and coders themselves. For coders, there’s the myth of the “cowboy” who can wrangle up the next big thing with just a few weeks of sleepless nights and marathon coding sessions.

For the non-technical, there’s the myth that coders are, um, “smart,” and will get the code right the first time around. That is naive at best, and overly optimistic at worst. A junior developer, without guidance, can make a mess of a perfectly good chunk of software, taking days or even weeks to fix. Even a senior developer can get stuck sometimes. The plan rarely survives writing the first line of code… assuming there was a plan to start with.

Both are myths for reason — decades of seeing software developers be the backbone of some of the largest companies in history has made us all blind to a few facts.

First, coders are human. They need to sleep, it takes energy to think, and they need breaks often to be even remotely productive. The myth of coding marathons simply needs to be thrown away and forgotten.

Second, it takes time to type on a keyboard. One doesn’t expect even the fastest of runners to complete a sprint or a marathon nearly instantly. When you have to type thousands and thousands of lines of code, it takes time and effort to physically move your fingers across the keyboard. Code doesn’t write itself.

Third and finally, most attempts at starting a software focused company (and most all reasonable sized companies have software involved somewhere, if only in IT) is hard work for everyone involved: C-level, HR, finance, software, manufacturing, and so on.

That’s where this article comes in.

The idea of the next big software app to change people’s lives for the better (and hopefully make a lot of cheddar 🧀) can come from anywhere. You don’t have to know a lick about coding to come up with something truly brilliant. You just have to be able to articulate your plan, manage your expectations, and hire the right developers and support staff to make your dreams come true &mdash; and you have to pay for that privilege, of course. Software doesn’t write itself and is a very specialized skill set. Coding is one of the purist examples of the phrase, “a moment to learn, a lifetime to master.”

Let’s start with that plan. You have to be crystal clear on what you want to create. Certain technologies lend themselves better to certain types of development better than others, so whoever you hire needs to be able to tell you in no-uncertain terms why what they offer is the best for your project.

It’s easy enough to verify technology — just do an Internet search and read a few articles. Ignore the tech mumbo-jumbo and look for details that confirm or deny the suggestion. Apple and Android alike have their own languages to write programs in, but both are based on other more common programming languages, so whatever a coder suggests can’t tie its way back to a big company the you’re familiar with, it’s probably too esoteric for you and thus probably too esoteric for your company.

What’s harder is to share enough of your plan so that the consultants or individuals you are considering hiring can provide intelligent solutions. A good consultant will work with your ideas and also tell you where it’s going to be a challenge to write code for it. What seems simple to you — put a button here and them make it do magic — might take hours and hours of coding to accomplish depending on what the user is expected to do and what the results are supposed to be (as well as what the existing code base looks like). An engaged team of developers will highlight those types of problems for you, and they will be worried if you think it’ll be “quick and easy,” because it won’t be.

That goes both ways; if a developer says, “Yeah, no problem” a little too quickly or too flippantly, then it’s a good sign to perhaps not engage that person’s services. The myth of the cowboy coder can raise its head long before the first line of code is written, and it’s important remember that coding is a challenging task, especially in the beginning when there are so many unknowns.

Ideally, the features of your dream application should be able to be broken down into four hour chunks or less. Initially, that’s simply not possible because of all of those unknowns. That said, if you’re looking to hire on a team, they should be able to tell you exactly that, and then share how they’ll have ongoing conversations with you so that they can do the appropriate amount of chunking. You’re going to need to be very patient in that regard, but the end result should be cleaner, more effective code that can easily adapt to future changes. Plans start slow, then accelerate as more and more well written code gets completed.

That brings us to expectations. The graphics and the interface seem super easy to complete, don't they? Put a splash of color here, a button there, and voila! you're done! But remember, for today’s modern applications, the entire Internet &mdash; a project that is decades in the making with trillions of dollars thrown behind it &mdash; is floating somewhere behind the nifty, shiny front end of your application (and if not the Internet, then at least a lot of intricate code that no one will ever see other than other coders).

Imagine the engine of a modern car — it has complexity far beyond that of cars that came off of the manufacturing lines a score of years ago. Car enthusiasts used to be able to spend hours tinkering on old-school cars with the tools in their garage. Now, they have to literally learn how to program if they want tweak the performance of their vehicle. Yet, you don’t see much, if any, of that as you drive your car down the freeway. Same goes for coding.

There is one expectation that you deserve to have met as the person hiring a team of developers: You have the right to know for sure that the code you hired a person to write will be written cleanly. Maybe not as the program first gets off the ground, but as development matures, the code that is delivered to you should be well-written and clean. As noted, that will make it easier to maintain in the future and easier to make upgrades with. It can’t and won’t be perfect, but it certainly can be good enough. The crux of the issue is, _how_ do you know that the code is written cleanly? (That's a topic for another day.)

We’re assuming you’re not a coder. You might not buy into the myths and you may treat your coders (and all your other employees) very well, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get well written code. You can’t be expected to look at sample code someone has written and understand what’s good and what’s bad. You can ask a lot of questions, however.
