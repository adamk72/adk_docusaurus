title: Snapshot Mindset

What do Continuous Delivery, Sprint Reviews, and Git Commits have in common? Within a short period of time, they all result in a functional demonstration of some feature, function, product, or service.

The snapshot mindset expands this idea: Every activity should be scaled into small enough chunks that each does not take a lot of time or effort, but collectively add up to a more complex system. The information that is embedded in these chunks could then in turn be rolled up in a hierarchical fashion, providing insight into the status of a project a various different levels. Such activities are usually easy to undo as well, meaning problems, if they arise, are found quickly and are able to be undone quickly.
This only works, however, if everyone provides a continuous stream of information, such as what actions where attempted and which succeeded or failed; what state the work is in, such as open, in progress, or closed; when and where codes was checked into version control, and so on.

Importantly, this system works best for everyone when certain guidelines and best practices are followed. The idea is to reduce friction in communication by communicating clearly and in the same way. Teams that do not have the discipline of following best practices end up with long laundry lists of "to-do" items that they are unsure of how to prioritize and what actually needs to be done (if anything). Such teams, along with the project manager and product owner, spend more time going over the work than actually doing the work itself.

## The Snapshot

Keep these things in mind to maintain a snapshot mindset:

1. Make changes frequently and in small, committable, chunks.
1. Record your activities and update the state of your progress.
1. Make statements that are clear and informative or actionable.
1. The more you share in a timely fashion, the better informed your co-workers will be, and the faster the team can work together.
