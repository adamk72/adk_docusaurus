Statement of Work
For SOWs, start with the template: AktaryTech SOW Starting Template V2.

There are generally two types of SOWs: Full Development and Design Sprints. Each has a very similar outline, but different approaches to the verbiage to be used. The template above contains text for both types; you will need to remove those sections not applicable to the type.

Design Sprint SOW
The Design Sprint is a high-level document meant to validate assumptions and understand the risks and strategic issues of bringing a new product to market. As such the artifacts generated are also high level, being wireframes, schemas, diagrams, and other similar documentation. Services like Figma may be employed to give additional life to the resulting deliverables, but the final result does not include a coded, functioning, prototype.

Design Sprints are oriented around the UI/UX are driven by the vision of the Client. The technical design aspects are relegated to thought exercises and documenting the plans, actions, and components necessary to build the software while not actually building the software.

A well-done Design Sprint can lead to far better execution of an MVP (which would be defined under a Technical Project SOW).

Technical Project SOW
A Technical Project is more complicated as it is a full-scope project, with information often derived from an earlier Design Sprint. As such, there needs to be considerably more detail when writing out the statement of work. A Technical Project can be looked at as the elaboration and execution of a Design Sprint.

If a Design Sprint was not run (this is fairly common) it is worthwhile including in the schedule time for a proper planning activity. A full planning activity will usually be split into multiple sprints and last longer than the typical Design Sprint. This is mainly because you are usually starting with more details than what one finds when generating a Design Sprint SOW. Many of concerns of the project have already been addressed, assumptions validated, and risks generally well understood.

Tips for Writing an SOW
Make use of the template to start.

Look at other SOWs for inspiration

Be clear and concise with your language. No plan survives first contact with reality, so there is no need to elaborate on every detail.

There is a difference between an Objective and a Deliverable, and there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between Objectives and Deliverables. The Objective statement should be short, one to three items at most. The Deliverables can (and likely will) be much longer, and includes tangible results that the client can take away, such as code, security keys, access to repositories and infrastructure, documentation, and more.

Objective: What is going to be done.

Deliverable: The resulting artifacts of what has been done.

There is a difference between Scope and Assumptions as well; Scope is very specific on what is going to be touched, used, or otherwise implemented (was well as what won't be acted on) while Assumptions are conditions and expectations surrounding all of the activities that are ongoing.

Scope: What we will (or won't) touch.

Assumption: Expectations of behavior and engagement.

Try to limit technical jargon.

If there seems to be a need to be extra wordy (or you have a lot of jargon or explanations), consider putting that content into an appendix at the end of the document and referring to it there. Is useful for boilerplate text in particular. However, do not use an appendix to hide information from the client. Anything remotely important should be in the main body of the Agreement and should be easily understood by both parties.

Remember that the goal of an SOW is to act as a guide line for the project, restrain the amount of work to measurable and actionable details, and to limit liability. For this last point, a poorly written SOW might leave the Company exposed to an unending stream of requests from the Client that have very little to do with the spirit of the contract. Likewise, a poorly written SOW might allow the Company to take advantage of the Client by denying them rightful services and demanding extra payment, contrary to the spirit of the contract.
